    fetchInfo = lib.mkOption {
      description = lib.mdDoc ''
        Arguments passed to fetchers to produce a package/module's source tree.

        This field may be explicitly set to `null` if `sourceInfo` is
        set instead.

        The `sourceInfo` produced by these arguments is primarily used for
        "discovery" and "translation" of project metadata to create a build
        plan, while `floco.packages.*.*.source` is what is used by builds.
        The default/fallback for `floco.packages.*.*.source` bottoms out here
        at `fetchInfo`, but you may find that it is more convenient/optimal to
        perform filtering of a source tree directly on
        `floco.packages.*.*.source` records rather than here to avoid
        prematurely copying trees to the Nix store in the event that they aren't
        needed for the eventual build plan.
      '';
    };


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

    sourceInfo = lib.mkOption {
      description = lib.mdDoc ''
        Information about the source tree a package resides in.
        This record is analogous to that returned by `builtins.fetchTree` for
        flake inputs.

        Used in combination with `fetchInfo` and `fsInfo.dir`, these three
        nuggets of metadata are isomorphic with a flake input.

        However, unlike flake inputs, `sourceInfo.outPath` may set to a derived
        store path if and only if `fetchInfo` is explicitly set to `null`.
        In this case `fsInfo.dir` is still used to identify a pacakage/module's
        root directory where we will attempt to read `package.json`
        ( must exist ) and similar metadata files will be read from
        ( if they exist ).

        In this case you may avoid `IFD` by explicitly setting top level fields,
        specifically `lifecycle`, `sysInfo`, `binInfo`, and `treeInfo` or
        `depInfo` which are required by builders.

        Alternatively you may explicitly set `metaFiles.{pjs,plock,plent,trees}`
        fields directly - but keep in mind that these fields are never
        guaranteed to be stable and their schema may change at any time
        ( so set the top level ones unless you`re up for the maintenance ).

            A Nix Store path containing the unpacked source tree in which this
            package/module resides.
            The package need not be at the root this path; but when the project
            root is a subdir the option `fsInfo.dir` must be set in order for
            `package.json` and other metadata to be translated.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

    # TODO: These fields really don't need to exist anymore since the NixOS
    # module system itself already provides these abstractions.
    # Because the entire beta repository uses `metaFiles.*' as its equivalent
    # of `config.*' "submodules" I'm basically just including this as a
    # temporary submodule to assist with migration.
    #
    # Whether or not this field will exist in the future is uncertain - but from
    # the perspective of users these fields are strictly internal and the
    # documentation below is eventually going to be moved into individual
    # translators associated with each filetype.
    metaFiles = lib.mkOption {
      internal    = true;
      description = lib.mdDoc ''
        Misc. raw config info pulled from various config files.
        In general these are used to fill other fields as fallbacks when
        explicit definitions are not given.

        Note that while builders will never directly refer to these fields -
        unless explicitly locked, these sub-options may trigger impure
        evaluation if builders attempt to reference them indirectly to derive
        defaults/fallbacks for other options.

        While other parts of a package's schema are strictly defined and can be
        treated as "stable" - `metaFiles` fields should be thought of as
        "internal" and may change or be extended to support new translators.

        For this reason let me be loud and clear:
        If you write a builder that directly refers to a `metaFiles` field, and
        it breaks because of a change to the `metaFiles` schema, and you proceed
        to file a bug report - you will be asked to stand in the corner of the
        classroom on top of your desk for the remainder of the day.
        Consider yourself warned.
