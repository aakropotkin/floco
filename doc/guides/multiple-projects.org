#+TITLE: Multiple Projects

=floco= was designed to make managing multiple local projects
easy, in fact it was originally designed to allow "recursive
local builds" in a way that =yarn= and =npm= really struggle
to provide.

The summary of this article for a =project-a= that depends on
=project-b= is basically:
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
{
  _file   = "project-a/floco-cfg.nix";
  imports = [
    ./pdefs.nix
    ./foverrides.nix
    ../project-b/floco-cfg.nix
  ];
}
#+END_SRC

* Files

The convention of organizating generated configs in
=pdefs.{json,nix}=, manual configuration in =foverrides.nix=,
and project/file organization in =floco-cfg.nix=
is recommended.

** =_file= Fields

While the =_file= field is optional, it is strongly 
recommended and the modules for certain records are sensitive
to filenames.
By setting =_file= explicitly you'll ensure that backtraces
and deserialization of configs use the given name regardless
of the "real" filename which can help avoid pitfalls.
