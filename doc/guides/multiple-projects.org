#+TITLE: Multiple Projects

=floco= was designed to make managing multiple local projects
easy, in fact it was originally designed to allow "recursive
local builds" in a way that =yarn= and =npm= really struggle
to provide.

The summary of this article for a `project-a` that depends on
`project-b`is basically:
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
{
  _file   = "project-a/floco-cfg.nix";
  imports = [
    ./pdefs.nix
    ./foverrides.nix
    ../project-b/floco-cfg.nix
  ];
}
#+END_SRC

The convention of organizating generated configs in
`pdefs.{json,nix}`, manual configuration in `foverrides.nix`,
and project/file organization in `floco-cfg.nix`
is recommended.
